## 6. Preview / Audit / Redaction

| Requirement | Status |
|---|---|
| Token redaction in preview | ✅ `tokenValue: 'REDACTED'` always |
| Token redaction in audit event | ✅ via `redactValue()` from @positron/shared |
| Body hash only (SHA-256), no raw text in preview | ✅ `bodyHash` + `bodyLength` only |
| No raw API output in audit | ✅ no `rawResponse`, `headers`, `authorizationHeader` fields |
| No full comment text in audit | ✅ only `bodyHash` |

## 7. Integration Point

The policy is designed as a standalone validatable module. Integration into the adapter write path requires:

1. Before any `RealGitHubAdapter` write method, call `policy.validate(params)`
2. If `validate()` returns `allowed: false`, throw/reject with the reason
3. If `validate()` returns `allowed: true`, proceed with the Octokit call
4. After successful write, call `policy.recordWrite(idempotencyKey)`
5. Audit events must be generated for both `allowed_preview` and `blocked` results

The full integration is deferred to a subsequent PR to keep this change scoped and reviewable.

## 9. Explicit Non-Actions

| Action | Executed? |
|---|---|
| Stage 2 write executed | **NO** |
| Real write token used | **NO** |
| GitHub write by Positron runtime | **NO** |
| GitHub read probe executed | **NO** |
| Push enabled | **NO** |
| Merge kill switch disabled | **NO** |
| Issue close by runtime | **NO** |
| Stage 3 executed | **NO** |
| Merge executed | **NO** |
| Token output in any form | **NO** |
| .env read/write | **NO** |

## 10. Go / No-Go

| Stage | Status |
|---|---|
| Stage 0 (Local Fake Mode Baseline) | GO |
| Stage 1 (ReadOnly validated) | GO — validated and documented |
| Stage 2 (Write Sandbox Policy) | **POLICY IMPLEMENTED — NOT EXECUTED** |
| Stage 3 (Supervised Pilot) | BLOCKED — depends on Stage 2 |

## 11. What Can Positron Do Now?

- Stage 2 Write-Sandbox Policy exists as a technical, testable module
- Sandbox allowlist is enforceable at runtime (not just documented)
- Pre-write preview generation is testable
- Redacted audit events are testable
- 41 negative/positive tests prove the policy blocks risky writes
- All existing tests (1967) continue to pass
- Stage 2 is still **not executed** — only the policy layer exists

## 12. What Remains Blocked?

- Real write token (POSITRON_STAGE2_GITHUB_TOKEN)
- Real GitHub write operation
- Stage 2 write dry run
- Push
- Merge
- Issue close
- Stage 3

## 13. Recommended Next Step

1. **Review this PR** — human Owner reviews the Stage 2 policy implementation ✅ (PR #361 MERGED)
2. **APPROVE FINAL AUDIT AND MERGE** — Owner approves merge ✅ (MERGED)
3. **After merge:** `APPROVE POSITRON STAGE 2 SANDBOX TARGET CREATION / SELECTION` ✅ (Done — `xxammaxx/positron-sandbox`, issue #1)
4. **Then:** Stage 2 Write Sandbox dry-run execution (separate run with real token)
5. **NOT directly:** Full real mode or Stage 3

**UPDATE 2026-07-09**: Sandbox target created. See `docs/evidence/stage2-sandbox-target.md`.
